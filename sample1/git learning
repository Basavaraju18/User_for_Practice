The git push operation is used to send your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub). Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use git push effectively in your Git workflow.


Basic git push Usage
1. Push changes to the current branch
If you have made changes and committed them locally, you can push them to the remote repository:
  > git push origin <branch-name>
  ex : For example, if you are on the main branch:
  
  > git push origin main
  or for the devlop branch:
  >git push origin devlop

2. Push a New Local Branch to Remote
If you have created a new branch and want to push it to GitHub:
 	> git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
 	
 	ex Example:

	>git push --set-upstream origin devlop
	Now, Git will remember this remote branch, and next time, you can simply use:

	>git push
	
	
	3. Push After Merging Another Branch
	If you have merged changes from main into devlop, and you want to push them:
	
	git checkout devlop
	git merge main
	git push origin devlop
	
	
	. Push Changes Forcefully (Use with Caution!)
	If you made changes locally that overwrite the remote branch history (not recommended unless necessary):


	git push --force
	⚠ Warning: This will overwrite history on the remote repository, so be careful!

	5. Push All Local Branches
	If you want to push all local branches to the remote repository:
	

	git push --all origin
	
	
	6. Push Tags (if you use version tagging)
	To push all tags to the remote repository:

	
	git push --tags
	========================
	
	Common Issues & Fixes
	Error: ‘rejected’ (fetch first)

	This happens when your remote branch has new commits that are not in your local branch. Fix it by pulling the 	latest changes before pushing:
	
	
	git pull --rebase origin <branch-name>
	git push origin <branch-name>
	
	
	
	Authentication Error

	If you are asked for a username and password but want to use SSH instead, check if your remote URL is set to 	HTTPS. Convert it to SSH:

	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Basavaraju18/User_for_Practice.git
	Then try pushing again.
