The git push operation is used to send your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to use git push effectively in your Git workflow.


Basic git push Usage
1. Push changes to the current branch
If you have made changes and committed them locally, you can push them to the remote repository:
  > git push origin <branch-name>
  ex : For example, if you are on the main branch:
  
  > git push origin main
  or for the devlop branch:
  >git push origin devlop

2. Push a New Local Branch to Remote
If you have created a new branch and want to push it to GitHub:
 	> git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
 	
 	ex Example:

	>git push --set-upstream origin devlop
	Now, Git will remember this remote branch, and next time, you can simply use:

	>git push
	
	
	3. Push After Merging Another Branch
	If you have merged changes from main into devlop, and you want to push them:
	
	git checkout devlop
	git merge main
	git push origin devlop
	
	
	. Push Changes Forcefully (Use with Caution!)
	If you made changes locally that overwrite the remote branch history (not recommended unless necessary):


	git push --force
	âš  Warning: This will overwrite history on the remote repository, so be careful!

	5. Push All Local Branches
	If you want to push all local branches to the remote repository:
	

	git push --all origin
	
	
	6. Push Tags (if you use version tagging)
	To push all tags to the remote repository:

	
	git push --tags
	========================
	
	Common Issues & Fixes
	Error: â€˜rejectedâ€™ (fetch first)

	This happens when your remote branch has new commits that are not in your local branch. Fix it by pulling the 	latest changes before pushing:
	
	
	git pull --rebase origin <branch-name>
	git push origin <branch-name>
	
	
	
	Authentication Error

	If you are asked for a username and password but want to use SSH instead, check if your remote URL is set to 	HTTPS. Convert it to SSH:

	git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Basavaraju18/User_for_Practice.git
	Then try pushing again.

	=====================================================================================
	
	Your `git status` output shows that you have **untracked files**, meaning they are new and not yet added to version control. To proceed with `git push`, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Add Untracked Files**
To include these new files in your commit, use:
```bash
git add .
```
or add specific files:
```bash
git add sample1/IT\ Experience sample1/Implimentaion\ Tasks\ In\ Project sample1/git\ learning
```
(`\` is used to escape spaces in file names)

---

### **2. Commit the Changes**
Once the files are added, commit them with a meaningful message:
```bash
git commit -m "Added IT Experience, Implementation Tasks, and Git Learning files"
```

---

### **3. Push the Changes to Remote Repository**
Since you're on the `develop` branch, push the changes using:
```bash
git push origin develop
```

If this is your first time pushing this branch, set the upstream branch:
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin develop
```
After this, next time, simply using `git push` will work.

---

### **4. Verify the Push**
After pushing, check the status to confirm everything is up to date:
```bash
git status
```
If it shows **"Your branch is up to date with 'origin/develop'."**, your push was successful! ðŸŽ‰

---

### **Common Issues & Fixes**
1. **Error: Rejected (fetch first)**
   - Run:
     ```bash
     git pull --rebase origin develop
     git push origin develop
     ```
   - This syncs your local branch with the remote before pushing.

2. **Permission Denied (Public Key)**
   - Check if SSH is set up correctly using:
     ```bash
     ssh -T git@github.com
     ```
   - If not, set up SSH authentication.

---

Once you've completed these steps, your files should be successfully pushed to GitHub! ðŸš€ Let me know if you face any issues.
